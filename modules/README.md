# Polybar Modules Configuration - made by ani

This directory contains modular configuration files for my Polybar setup. I've decided to separate these components from my main `config.ini` to improve organization and maintainability. This approach allows me to easily manage and update specific parts of my bar without cluttering the primary configuration file.

## Files in this directory

- `colors.ini`: I use this file to define all the color schemes for my Polybar. This makes it easy for me to change the entire color palette of my bar by modifying a single file.
- `modules.ini`: Here, I define the individual Polybar modules that I use, such as CPU usage, memory, network, and more. I find it cleaner to define each module's specific settings in its own section within this file.
- `wal_colors.ini`: This file is specifically for colors generated by `wal` (pywal), which I use to dynamically set my bar's colors based on my wallpaper. I include this separately to integrate my theming seamlessly.

By keeping these configurations separate, I can easily mix and match modules, update color schemes, and ensure my Polybar setup remains flexible and robust.
